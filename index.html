    <p>There are two versions:</p>
    
    <h2> <a href="simple.html">Simple control</a></h2>
    <p> A single PID manages all phases of driving. In this mode, the car has a tendancy to oscillate on straight track,  but it can attain huge speeds.
      The cause of the oscillation would seem to be the overly simplied measured variable which is simply the difference between the distances to the two white lines.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="modal.html">Modal control</a></h2>
    <p> Pid parameters are tuned to specific drivng modes. In this version, a second sensor provides
      information about the car's heading as well as its position on the track. There are two modes:
      <ul>
	<li><i>Mode 0:</i> seeks to place the car on the center-line of the track</li>
	<li><i>Mode 1:</i>  seeks to align the car's heading with that of the track.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>In this so called modal steering, the car oscillates less, but it loses control earlier than in the simple driving mode
      model. I'm not sure if better PID tuning would help or not. The PID parameters can still be edited with the buttons on the upper left.</p>
    <p> In both cases, the frame-rate is critical and should be as close to 50 as possbile. If your browser cannot achieve 50 fps, then you should
      download the native processing version and try it out!</p>
